route->action (controller) -> template(view)

Ruby on Rails Tutorial Sample App | <%= yield(:title) %>

Adding a new page:
- add a new route
- add a new controller action
- add the view
Creating a new Controller
rails generate controller Users new --no-test-framework

Creating a new test rspec test script
rails generate integration_test user_pages

Rails generate:
- Model (just the model)
- Controller (Controller + view associated with actions)
- Scaffold (Model + controller + views for multiple database interactions)

After changing the data model, we need to migrate the database to
align our data structure with our web application
$ bundle exec rake db:migrate

Development and test environment have separate data models, so models we created
in the development will not be visible in the test environment, and thus we need
to run the command:
$ bundle exec rake db:test:prepare

to tell the test database that the database has the structure that we have created
in the development
